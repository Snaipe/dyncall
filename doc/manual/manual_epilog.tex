\section{Epilog}

\subsection{Stability and security considerations}

Since the \product{dyncall} library doesn't know anything about the called
function itself (except its address), no parameter-type validation is done.
This means that in order to avoid crashes, data corruption, etc., the user is
required to ascertain the number and types of parameters. It is strongly advised to
double check the parameter types of every function to be called, and not to
call unknown functions at all.\\

Consider a simple program that issues a call by directly passing some
unchecked command line arguments to the call itself, or even worse, by indirectly
choosing a library and a function to call without verification.
Such unchecked input data can quite easily be used to intentionally crash the
program or to hijack it by taking over control of the program flow.\\
To put it in a nutshell, if not used with care, programs depending on the
\product{dyncall}, \product{dyncallback} and \product{dynload} libraries,
can be exploited as arbitrary function call dispatchers through manipulating
of their input data. Successful exploits of programs like the example outlined above
can be sed as very powerful tools for a wide variety of malicious attacks, \ldots
 

\subsection{Embedding}

The \product{dyncall} library strives to have a minimal set of dependencies,
meaning no required runtime dependencies and usually only the necessary tools
to build the library as build-time dependencies.
The library uses some heap-memory to store the CallVM and uses by default the
platform's \capi{malloc()} and \capi{free()} calls. However, providing custom
\capi{dcAllocMem()} and \capi{dcFreeMem()} functions will override the default
behaviour.
See \shell{dyncall/dyncall\_alloc.h} for details.


\subsection{Multi-threading}

The \product{dyncall} library is thread-safe and reentrant, by means that it
works correctly during execution of multiple threads if, and only if there is
at most a single thread pushing arguments to one CallVM (invoking the call is
always thread-safe, though). Since there's no limitation on the number of
created CallVM objects, it is recommended to keep a copy for each thread if
mutliple thread make use of \product{dyncall} at once.


\subsection{Supported types}

Currently, the \product{dyncall} library supports all of ANSI C's integer,
floating point and pointer types as function call arguments as well as return
values. Additionally, C++'s \capi{bool} and C99's \capi{\_Bool} types are supported.
Due to the still rare and often incomplete support of the \capi{long double} type
on various platforms, the latter is currently not officially supported.


\subsection{Roadmap}

The \product{dyncall} library should be extended by a wide variety of other
calling conventions and ported to other and more esoteric platforms. With its low
memory footprint it surely might come in handy on embedded systems.
Furthermore, the authors plan to provide more scripting language bindings,
examples, and other projects based on \product{dyncall}.\\
Besides \product{dyncall} and \product{dyncallback}, the \product{dynload}
library needs to be extended with support for other shared library formats
(e.g. AmigaOS .library or GEM \cite{.ldg} files).


\subsection{Related libraries}

Besides the \product{dyncall} library, there are other free and open projects
with similar goals. The most noteworthy libraries are libffi \cite{libffi},
C/Invoke \cite{cinvoke} and libffcall \cite{libffcall}.
